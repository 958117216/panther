En este repo:
	Make sure qyaw_guess is feasible (because I commit to it when ipopt doesn't find a solution)
	Improve the way qyaw_guess is generated
	max_runtime_casadi
	Install good linear solver Ipopt
	Check everything in yaw_guess_generator works as expected
	Impose yaw_max in yaw_guess_generator?
	Read casadi functions only once!!
	see TODOs in yaw_guess_generator
	Include the velocity of the obstacle in the cost function!!! (Eq. 11.3 of https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~pemantle/110-public/notes11.pdf)
	Anadir jerk and spherical constraints en C++
	Uncomment smooth pyramid (instead of cone)
	Circular statistics, circular regression for the yaw 
	Have a look at https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/fnxtr.html
	Hungarian Algorithm: 
		See https://github.com/srianant/kalman_filter_multi_object_tracking/blob/master/tracker.py
		and https://github.com/t3nsor/codebook/blob/master/bipartite-mincost.cpp
	Cuidado que los assert() SOLO funcionan en debug mode, no en release mode. Change this also in Mader original code
	Schur complement to avoid inverting the whole matrix?
	Should I leave the planes fixed or as decision variables??
	Check if the obj function chosen is the best one
	Make yaw compatible with yaw definition in acl-stack
	Cuidado que guess_yaw doesn't use the constraint yaw_dot_max, while the optimization problem does
	Cuidado que guess_pos doesn't use the constraint jerk_max, while the optimization problem does
	Enhacement: The predictor should use the pwp field (instead of the string field) of dynTraj. This will require changes in mader.cpp (how is_agent is used)

	Try creating a NLOPT object each time.
