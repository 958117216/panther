En este repo:
	Make sure qyaw_guess is feasible (because I commit to it when ipopt doesn't find a solution)
	Improve the way qyaw_guess is generated
	max_runtime_casadi
	Install good linear solver Ipopt
	Check everything in yaw_guess_generator works as expected
	Impose yaw_max in yaw_guess_generator?
	Read casadi functions only once!!
	see TODOs in yaw_guess_generator
