En este repo:
	Make sure qyaw_guess is feasible (because I commit to it when ipopt doesn't find a solution)
	Improve the way qyaw_guess is generated
	max_runtime_casadi
	Install good linear solver Ipopt
	Check everything in yaw_guess_generator works as expected
	Impose yaw_max in yaw_guess_generator?
	Read casadi functions only once!!
	see TODOs in yaw_guess_generator
	Include the velocity of the obstacle in the cost function!!! (Eq. 11.3 of https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~pemantle/110-public/notes11.pdf)
	Anadir jerk and spherical constraints en C++
	Uncomment smooth pyramid (instead of cone)
	Circular statistics, circular regression for the yaw 
	Have a look at https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/fnxtr.html
	Hungarian Algorithm: 
		See https://github.com/srianant/kalman_filter_multi_object_tracking/blob/master/tracker.py
		and https://github.com/t3nsor/codebook/blob/master/bipartite-mincost.cpp
	Cuidado que los assert() SOLO funcionan en debug mode, no en release mode. Change this also in Mader original code
	Schur complement to avoid inverting the whole matrix?

En MADER:
	Try creating a NLOPT object each time.
