En este repo:
	Make sure qyaw_guess is feasible (because I commit to it when ipopt doesn't find a solution)
	Improve the way qyaw_guess is generated
	max_runtime_casadi
	Install good linear solver Ipopt
	Check everything in yaw_guess_generator works as expected
	Impose yaw_max in yaw_guess_generator?
	Read casadi functions only once!!
	see TODOs in yaw_guess_generator
	Check the partial derivatives of velocity of the obstacle in the cost function is right
	Anadir jerk and spherical constraints en C++
	Uncomment smooth pyramid (instead of cone)
	Circular statistics, circular regression for the yaw 
	Have a look at https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/fnxtr.html
	Hungarian Algorithm: 
		See https://github.com/srianant/kalman_filter_multi_object_tracking/blob/master/tracker.py
		and https://github.com/t3nsor/codebook/blob/master/bipartite-mincost.cpp
	Cuidado que los assert() SOLO funcionan en debug mode, no en release mode. Change this also in Mader original code
	Schur complement to avoid inverting the whole matrix?
	Should I leave the planes fixed or as decision variables??
	Check if the obj function chosen is the best one
	Make yaw compatible with yaw definition in acl-stack
	Cuidado que guess_yaw doesn't use the constraint yaw_dot_max, while the optimization problem does
	Cuidado que guess_pos doesn't use the constraint jerk_max, while the optimization problem does
	Enhancement: The predictor should use the pwp field (instead of the string field) of dynTraj. This will require changes in mader.cpp (how is_agent is used)
	Enable the -O3 option when compiling all the mader package
	See what to do when boost() doesn't find a path (end of yaw_guess_generator.cpp)
	In the graph for the yaw, impose the yaw_dot_max en las conexiones de los yaw angles
	Asegurarse que el yaw no explota (wrap yaw0)
	Check la heuristics del graph del yaw
	Check los weights en la heuristics del graph del yaw
	See %TODO: should we include total_time here below? in main.m
	Check that the T matrix in the tracker is the right one (and not its inverse)
	Add VIO term in the cost function
	See https://pointclouds.org/documentation/classpcl_1_1_shadow_points.html#details
	The FOV of Gazebo should be consistent with fov_x_deg and fov_y_deg
	Check max_number_of_obstacles (creo que ahora hago abort())
	b_T_c should be a parameter in main.m
