En este repo:
	Make sure qyaw_guess is feasible (because I commit to it when ipopt doesn't find a solution)
	max_runtime_casadi
	Install good linear solver Ipopt
	Check everything in yaw_guess_generator works as expected
	Impose yaw_max in yaw_guess_generator?
	see TODOs in yaw_guess_generator
	Check the partial derivatives of velocity of the obstacle in the cost function is right
	Uncomment smooth pyramid (instead of cone) [DONE, but it's commented out]
	Cuidado que los assert() SOLO funcionan en debug mode, no en release mode. Change this also in Mader original code
	Should I leave the planes fixed or as decision variables??
	Check if the obj function chosen is the best one
	Make yaw compatible with yaw definition in acl-stack
	Cuidado que guess_yaw doesn't use the constraint yaw_dot_max, while the optimization problem does
	Cuidado que guess_pos doesn't use the constraint jerk_max, while the optimization problem does
	Enable the -O3 option when compiling all the mader package
	Asegurarse que el yaw no explota (wrap yaw0)
	Check la heuristics del graph del yaw
	See %TODO: should we include total_time here below? in main.m
	Check that the T matrix in the tracker is the right one (and not its inverse)
	Add VIO term in the cost function
	The FOV of Gazebo should be consistent with fov_x_deg and fov_y_deg
	Check max_number_of_obstacles (creo que ahora hago abort())
	wait duration for looking up transform in tracker
	Como decidir entre varios obstaculos (ahora cojo traj_0 creo)
	Predict the uncertainty and apply it to the polyhedra
	param 'basis' in mader.yaml is not used in the MATLAB files. Move it to MATLAB and store it in *casadi.yaml. But then I have to include the Bezier control points
	Create a dataset of the moving objects from the experiments??

Future/enhancements:
	Schur complement to avoid inverting the whole matrix?
	The predictor should use the pwp field (instead of the string field) of dynTraj. This will require changes in mader.cpp (how is_agent is used)
	Yaw generator should go to a different class
	See what to do when boost() doesn't find a path (end of yaw_guess_generator.cpp) [right now there is an abort(), since it should never happen]
	See https://pointclouds.org/documentation/classpcl_1_1_shadow_points.html#details


Novale:
	Have a look at https://www.mathworks.com/help/curvefit/fnxtr.html
	Hungarian Algorithm: 
		See https://github.com/srianant/kalman_filter_multi_object_tracking/blob/master/tracker.py
		and https://github.com/t3nsor/codebook/blob/master/bipartite-mincost.cpp

Done: 
	Circular statistics, circular regression for the yaw 

Decir en el paper:
	In the graph for the yaw, we are imposing the yaw_dot_max en las conexiones de los yaw angles (with very high cost)

	Try creating a NLOPT object each time.
