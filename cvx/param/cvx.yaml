#debug: true

wdx: 8.0  #[m] world dimension in x
wdy: 8.0  #[m] world dimension in y
wdz: 3.0   #[m] world dimension in z
res: 0.3  #[m] cell dimension = resolution of the map


dc: 0.01            #(seconds) Duration for the interpolation=Value of the timer pubGoal
goal_radius: 0.2    #(m) Drone has arrived to the goal when distance_to_goal<GOAL_RADIUS
drone_radius: 0.2  #(m) Used for collision checking


offset: 10  # Replanning offset (the initial conditions are taken OFFSET states farther from the last published goal)

Ra: 0.5            # [m] Minimum radius of the first sphere
Rb: 6.0             # [m] Radius of the second sphere
w_max: 1            # [rd/s] Maximum angular velocity
alpha_0: 0.25         #[rd] threshold to ignore current JPS solution, and consider the old one. 0--> always decide
z_ground: 0.2         #[m] points below this are considered ground
z_max: 1.5         #[m] JPS is not allowed to give a solution that goes higher than this height
inflation_jps: 0.6  #[m] The obstacles are inflated (to run JPS) by this amount
factor_jps: 1  #[m] JPS is run with resolution=factor_jps*(resolution of the map)


v_max: 1   #[m/s]
a_max: 4   #[m/s2]
j_max: 15  #[m/s3]

q: 100000  #[-] weight to the 2nd term of the cost function for cvxgen

z_land: 0.02 #[m] z goal for landing

#Ways to force the drone to fly faster:
#increase Ra
#increase v_max, a_max, j_max

#Ways to make the planner faster:
# Increase deltaT in each cvxgen iteration
# Timer of the mapper
# More downsampling in the frontier point cloud
# downsample instanteneous point clouds from the camera?
# compile cvxgen with the option -03 (see makefile of cvxgen) instead of -0s
# set a different resolution for the JPS solver (change factor_jps)
# reduce dimensions/increase resolution of the map
# Run the mapper as a nodelet
# Reduce alpha_0
# Max out Jetson TX2 (overclocking, modprob,...)

#Things to try
#Change radius spheres Sa and Sb
#verify publish index and offset are working

#Things to do
#Change -1 in the instantaneous point cloud
#Run 
# Omit visualization stuff
# Selection between J1 and J2 
# z_max change
